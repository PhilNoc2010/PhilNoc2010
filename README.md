- 👋 Hi, I’m Phil
- 👀 I’m interested in coding, gaming, improv comedy, and the MCU
- 🌱 I’ve recently completed the Coding Dojo bootcamp, focusing on Full Stack Development in Python, Javascript (MERN), and C#.
- I'm open to opportunities of all types, but I'm most excited to work again in the MERN stack.  

One of my projects was to re-create the Comedy Robot, a site I encountered during the early 2010's:

Another project was to create a Proof of Concept of Ultimate Wizard, a remake of a the Commodore 64 game of the same name:
